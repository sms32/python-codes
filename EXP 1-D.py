# AIM: Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 15. For multiples of two print 
"Karunya" instead of the number and for the multiples of three print "University". For 
numbers which are multiples of both two and three print "KarunyaUniversity".

"""
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: set range of i between 0 and 15 
STEP 3:if i is remiander for 2 or 3 then
STEP 4:print KARUNYA UNIVERSITY
STEP 5:if i is remainder for 2 then print KARUNYA
STEP 6:if i is remainder for 3 then print UNIVERSITY
STEP 7: DISPLAY OUTPUT
STEP 8: STOP

for i in range(0,15):
