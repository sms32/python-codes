#Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 15. For multiples of two print 
"Karunya" instead of the number and for the multiples of three print "University". For 
numbers which are multiples of both two and three print "KarunyaUniversity".


for i in range(0,15):
    if(i%2 and i%3):
        print("KARUNYA UNIVERSITY")
    if(i%2):
        print("KARUNYA")
    if(i%3):
        print("UNIVERSITY")
